## Project Description:
### Analyzing Global Warming:
Global air temperature level is affected by the quantity of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. By keeping air temperature as target variable and major greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane as predictor variables, a linear regression model is built to predict the temperature increase in upcoming years.
